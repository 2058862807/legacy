#### Step 1: HTTPS and Security Headers (Hours 25-28)
```python
# Add security middleware to FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=["your-app.railway.app"])
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://your-frontend.railway.app"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Security headers
@app.middleware("http")
async def add_security_headers(request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    response.headers["Strict-Transport-Security"] = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
    return response
```

#### Step 2: Input Validation and Sanitization (Hours 29-32)
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement HTML sanitization for user inputs
- [ ] Add SQL injection protection (SQLAlchemy handles most)
- [ ] Validate file uploads and limit file sizes

#### Step 3: Rate Limiting Enhancement (Hours 33-36)
```python
# Enhanced rate limiting
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

# Apply to sensitive endpoints
@app.post("/api/wills")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def create_will(request: Request, ...):
    # Will creation with rate limiting
```

### Success Criteria
âœ… Basic security measures prevent common attacks and abuse
