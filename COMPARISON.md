[Dashboard] [Pricing]            <- Plain buttons, no footer

## 🚨 **The Problem:**
Your Vercel deployment is still using the OLD code from your GitHub repository. The modern design exists in this development environment but hasn't been copied to your repo yet.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**
1. Copy the 7 key files from this environment to your GitHub repo
2. Push to main branch  
3. Redeploy on Vercel without cache
4. You'll immediately see the modern design!

## 🎯 **Proof the Modern Design is Ready:**
The code in this environment builds successfully (32 pages) and contains:
- Professional gradient branding
- Complete footer with legal links  
- Cutting-edge login page with animations
- Modern dashboard and document management
- Comprehensive legal pages

**The modern design is 100% ready - it just needs to be deployed!** 🚀
