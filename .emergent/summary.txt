The AI engineer successfully took the NexteraEstate application from an initial, partially broken state to a production-ready application. The primary challenge involved resolving persistent deployment issues across Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend), specifically related to Next.js prerendering, module resolution, and backend dependency management.

The engineer systematically refactored the codebase, modernized the UI for key pages (Login, Homepage, Will, Vault), and implemented critical features: NextAuth v5 (Google OAuth), Stripe payments, AI bots, and Polygon blockchain notarization. A major new feature, a 50-state real-time compliance system, was designed and implemented, including a PostgreSQL backend and a responsive frontend UI. The engineer meticulously addressed repeated user complaints about deployment failures and non-visible changes, providing detailed explanations and fixing port mismatches for local previews. The transition from server-side  to client-side MetaMask for blockchain interaction, and comprehensive backend dependency audits, highlight the engineer's robust problem-solving. The final phase involved a full audit and documentation for production readiness.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal was to deliver a stable, feature-rich NexteraEstate application, deployable on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend), with a custom domain  and  respectively.

**Initial Phase Requirements:**
1.  **Repository Cleanup:** Consolidate frontend to , removing root-level duplicates.
2.  **Frontend Setup:** Implement Tailwind CSS, configure  for aliases (later removed), ensure  and  integration. Configure  for rewrites.
3.  **Rebranding:** Replace FurEstate with NexteraEstate company-wide.
4.  **Core Features:**
    *   **Authentication:** NextAuth v5 with Google OAuth (including Google Cloud Console configuration).
    *   **Payments:** Stripe integration for checkout (, ) with success/cancel pages.
    *   **AI Bots:** Frontend widgets (, ) and backend endpoints (, ).
    *   **Blockchain Notarization:** Initially Polygon Amoy testnet with , later shifted to client-side MetaMask integration for user wallet control.
5.  **UI Modernization:** Transform basic pages (Login, Will Builder, Document Vault, Homepage) into modern, feature-rich experiences.
6.  **Legal Pages:** Create and link Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.
7.  **Deployment:** Configure Vercel (root directory, build commands, environment variables) and Railway (start command, environment variables, PostgreSQL).
8.  **Quality Bar:**  must pass, Google login functional, Stripe checkout working, Notarization returning Polygonscan link, Lighthouse score 85+.

**Mid-Phase Requirement (50-State Real-time Compliance):**
1.  **Backend:** Implement a PostgreSQL database with  and  tables. Create a seed JSON (). Implement API endpoints: , ,  with 15-minute in-memory caching.
2.  **Frontend:** Create ,  (with state selector, doc type tabs), and integrate a badge on .
3.  **UX Rules:** Show citations, updated date, info banner if  is false, link to Notary page if .
4.  **Deployment:** Configure  and  on Railway and Vercel.

**Final Production Readiness Requirements:**
Consolidate all previous requirements, add observability (Sentry, uptime), email integration (Resend/Postmark), security (HTTPS, secure cookies, rate limiting), SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, meta tags, favicon), and DNS configuration (Namecheap). Ensure a clean repository structure (frontend only in ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback that the feature cards on the homepage () were dead links and should lead to professional explanation pages.

The engineer's last action was:
1.  **Identify Dead Links:** Located the feature cards in .
2.  **Start Wrapping in Links:** Began the process of making these cards clickable by wrapping them in  components.
3.  **Plan New Pages:** Stated the intention to create dedicated, professional feature explanation pages that these links will point to.

The application is otherwise declared production-ready, with all major features (Google Login, Stripe, AI Bots, Polygon Notarization via MetaMask, 50-State Compliance) implemented, configured, and tested locally. The previous major issues regarding Vercel prerendering errors and Railway crashes due to  dependencies have been resolved. The engineer has also generated comprehensive deployment guides and documentation. The current task is a refinement of the homepage UX to make the feature cards functional and informative.
