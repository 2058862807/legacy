<analysis>
The previous AI engineer demonstrated a persistent challenge in ensuring a consistent working state between the local development environment and the user's experience in preview/production. A recurring pattern involved fixing reported issues, only for the user to report similar or related failures, often due to environment variable precedence, NextAuth configuration, or incorrect URL routing for deployed applications. Significant effort was invested in refactoring frontend-backend communication via Next.js API routes, eliminating mock data, addressing TypeScript build errors, integrating a professional logo, and migrating AI services to the Emergent LLM. The trajectory culminated in a comprehensive production deployment guide and the initial architectural setup for a Live Estate Plan feature.

<product_requirements>
The NexteraEstate application aims to provide a stable, feature-rich platform for estate planning, deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend). Initial requirements included a monorepo, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth v5 (Google OAuth), Stripe payments, AI bots (Help, Grief), client-side MetaMask blockchain notarization, UI modernization for key pages, and creation of legal pages (Privacy, Terms). Subsequent requests focused on a 50-state real-time compliance system, rebranding the Help Bot to Esquire AI, fixing API 404s and coming soon placeholders, ensuring database saving, resolving Vercel/Railway crashes, adding social media logos, trademark, document upload/listing, PDF generation, a Pet Trust feature, and Contact Support. The user's ultimate intent is a 100% functional, personally testable, production-ready platform. The latest major request is for a Live Estate Plan feature to keep documents current as laws and life change, by watching rules and user triggers, proposing updates, and re-generating/notarizing.

-   Complete the full implementation of the Live Estate Plan feature (Watchers, Engine, Actions, Proof).
-   Implement a complete Email System (confirmations, resets, notifications).
-   Implement full Subscription Management (for users to manage plans/billing).
-   Implement Sentry for frontend and backend observability.
-   Add uptime checks for site and API.
-   Add screenshots of the dashboard and a How it works section on the homepage.
-   Implement rate limits on public endpoints.
-   Final testing on actual deployed production environment (Vercel/Railway) as the preview environment remains problematic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating a major new feature: the Live Estate Plan. This feature is designed to keep estate documents current with changing laws and personal life events. The system would monitor 50-state rules and user triggers, propose updates, then re-generate, sign, notarize, and re-hash documents on Polygon, maintaining an audit trail.

The AI engineer has completed the initial architectural setup for this feature:
-   A new backend file, , was created to house the core logic for the dynamic updates.
-   The main backend  was modified to integrate this new engine, likely setting up initial endpoints or services for it.
-   Three new frontend components were created:
    -   
    -   
    -   
    These components are intended to provide the user interface for managing the live estate plan, displaying update notifications, and configuring related settings.

This work followed extensive fixes to the application, including resolving numerous build errors, rectifying persistent connectivity issues (due to hardcoded URLs and  misconfigurations), integrating a professional logo with optimized rendering, migrating AI services to the cost-effective Emergent LLM key, and applying a significant styling/content overhaul to modernize the UI based on user feedback. The application is now positioned as having a professional design and all core features implemented, with a comprehensive deployment guide generated.
