# NexteraEstate Testing Protocol

## User Problem Statement
User requested to "finish fixing pages" for the NexteraEstate application. The application is an estate planning platform with NextAuth authentication, Stripe payments, AI bots, and blockchain notarization features.

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines:
- Test core API endpoints for functionality
- Verify environment variable configuration
- Check database connectivity (MongoDB)
- Test payment processing endpoints

- Validate form submissions
- Check API integration from frontend
- Test component interactions

### Communication Protocol with Testing Sub-agents:
- Provide clear, specific testing objectives
- Include relevant context about recent changes
- Request comprehensive test coverage
- Ask for specific error reproduction steps
- Request validation of critical user flows

## Current Status

### Completed Work:
‚úÖ Fixed all import path errors in React components
‚úÖ Resolved SessionProvider duplication issues  
‚úÖ Added missing CSS utility classes
