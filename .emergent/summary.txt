The previous AI engineer's work focused on stabilizing the NexteraEstate application, which was plagued by persistent 502 errors and deployment failures on Railway. Initial attempts involved fixing a Python FastAPI backend, then rewriting it to TypeScript/Express (abandoned due to Railway deployment issues), and finally hotfixing the existing Python backend. Core functionalities like authentication, will builder, and AI bots were either broken or in demo mode. The AI engineer made numerous attempts to align Railway's build process (Nixpacks vs. Dockerfile, Python vs. Node.js detection) with the actual Python FastAPI backend, often getting stuck in a loop of pip command not found or no start command found errors despite local successes. The user provided highly prescriptive, detailed plans to guide the AI through middleware, API routing ( to  migration), feature flags, health checks, and initial Stripe/AI endpoint implementations. While local code changes were implemented, the fundamental issue of reliable production deployment on Railway remained unresolved, consistently resulting in 502 errors, leading to significant user frustration. The trajectory concludes with the AI accepting a final, comprehensive plan from the user, with the core Railway deployment still blocking full functionality.

<product_requirements>
The NexteraEstate application aims to be a stable, legally defensible estate planning platform. Key features include NextAuth v5, Stripe payments, gasless MetaMask notarization (with blockchain fees included and no crypto wallet required messaging), a 50-state Real-Time Compliance System, Esquire AI and other AI bots (Grief, Master Dev), document management, PDF generation, and a Live Estate Plan. User frustrations initially stemmed from persistent 502 errors, 404s, and non-functional features. Explicit requirements escalated to include: a redesign of front-page pricing, site-wide mobile responsiveness, enhancing credibility (testimonials, trust badges), clarifying Polygon to Blockchain, implementing a Polygon wallet/MATIC price monitoring, How it Works section, comprehensive onboarding, and a dashboard Crypto Assets Card. The core problem revolved around making the AI-powered will builder, compliance system, and all AI bots fully functional and secure, transitioning blockchain integration from testnet to mainnet, and achieving stable Railway/Vercel deployments free of API connectivity issues and routing mismatches ( vs ). Security (auth on protected pages), observability (logging, diagnostics), and a unified routing strategy were critical.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in an intensive, time-constrained effort to stabilize the NexteraEstate backend deployment on Railway and wire up core functionalities, following a highly detailed, prescriptive plan from the user (Chat Message 526).

The AI engineer has:
1.  **Railway Stability (Local Done, Production Pending)**: Numerous attempts were made to fix persistent Railway deployment issues (e.g., pip command not found, no start command). This involved modifying Dockerfiles, , , and moving Python files ( to ) to conform to Railway's auto-detection logic (Nixpacks vs. Dockerfile). Although locally, the backend () now successfully runs with all health, diagnostics, and API shim routes, Railway production deployments consistently return 502 Bad Gateway errors, indicating the backend is still not starting correctly on the platform. The user also explicitly denied the AI to use the Railway token.
2.  **Routing Unification**: The frontend environment variable  is set to . Frontend API calls are being updated to use a centralized helper and  prefix. A temporary backend shim () has been added in  to remap incoming  requests to  paths, with logging, to prevent immediate 404s.
3.  **Core API Endpoints**: Health (, ), diagnostics (), and initial Stripe (, ) and AI () endpoints have been implemented/verified locally.
4.  **Security**: Next.js middleware () enforces authentication for protected routes (, , , ).
5.  **Feature Flags**: Backend () has ,  flags, with UI gating planned.
6.  **Observability**: Backend logs now include route table printing on boot, and local API smoke tests (ðŸš€ NexteraEstate API Smoke Tests (TypeScript/Express)

==================================

Testing health: GET /health) are in place and passing locally.

The primary blocker is the **persistent failure of the backend to deploy and run successfully on Railway**, despite local functionality and numerous configuration adjustments. The user has provided an extensive 12-hour plan (to be completed in 45 minutes) that outlines the remaining steps.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to diagnose and resolve the persistent 502 Bad Gateway error on Railway, leveraging the detailed PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT DEBUG guide created and the explicit instructions provided in the last user prompt to get the backend successfully booting and accessible on the production environment.
