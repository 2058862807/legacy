   - Improved error handling with proper HTTP status codes

2. **Enhanced Notarization** (`/api/notary/create`):
   - Added hash format validation (must be valid hexadecimal)
   - Added hash length validation (must be 64 characters for SHA256)
   - Clean hash input processing (remove 0x prefix, lowercase)
   - Comprehensive error messages for different validation failures

3. **Added Logging**:
   - Implemented proper logging for debugging blockchain operations
