git push origin main
```

## 🎯 **Step 3: Vercel Settings Check**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → Settings
2. **Root Directory**: Must be set to `web`
3. **Environment Variables**: Add these if missing:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://nexteraestate.com
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[32-char-secret]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[your-google-id]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[your-google-secret]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://api.nexteraestate.com
   ```

## 🚨 **Step 4: Force Fresh Deploy**

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Deployments
2. **Redeploy** latest deployment
3. **Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"** ⚠️ CRITICAL
4. **Deploy**

## 🔍 **Step 5: Cache Clearing**

1. **Vercel**: Settings → Functions → Clear All Cache
2. **Browser**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **CDN**: Wait 5-10 minutes for global cache clear

## ✅ **Expected Result After Deployment:**

You should see:
- ✅ Modern gradient NexteraEstate homepage  
- ✅ Professional footer with legal links
- ✅ Cutting-edge login page with animations
- ✅ Working privacy policy at `/privacy`
- ✅ Working terms of service at `/terms`

## 🚨 **If Still Showing Old Design:**

1. **Check Git**: Verify files were actually pushed to GitHub
2. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look for build errors in deployment logs
3. **Check Browser**: Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. **Check Root Directory**: Ensure Vercel root directory = `web`

## 📞 **Quick Fix Checklist:**

- [ ] Copy all 7 files above to GitHub repo
- [ ] Push changes to main branch  
- [ ] Set Vercel root directory to `web`
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Redeploy without cache
- [ ] Clear browser cache
