    question: 'What is MetaMask?',
    answer: 'MetaMask is a secure digital wallet used by millions to manage cryptocurrency and blockchain assets.\n\nYou do not need MetaMask to use our service. Your estate plan will always be notarized on the blockchain, and all blockchain fees are already included in your package.\n\nMetaMask is optional. Only connect it if you want to link your crypto holdings and include them in your estate plan.\n\nOnce connected, your wallet address will appear in your dashboard and your estate plan will include your crypto assets.\n\nBottom line: Most users skip this step. MetaMask is there for advanced users who want to add digital assets.',

    answer: 'We use Stripe for secure payments. You see the exact price and terms before you pay. No hidden fees or surprises.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a crypto wallet for blockchain features?',
    answer: 'No! You don\'t need any cryptocurrency wallet or technical knowledge. We handle all blockchain operations behind the scenes, and all fees are included in your plan. It\'s completely automatic and hassle-free.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is blockchain proof?',
    answer: 'We store a hash of your file on Blockchain to prove existence and timestamp. This creates an immutable record of when your document was created. No crypto wallet required - all blockchain fees are included in your plan.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I export my documents?',
    answer: 'Yes. You can download your files anytime in PDF format. Your documents belong to you.'
